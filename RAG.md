## SHANE'S PHILOSOPHY

### On Problem Solving
1. **Gossip has no place** - Never use it to solve anything
2. **Second-hand information is never 100% correct** - Don't rely on it
3. **Take your time** - When presented with a problem, think of EVERY outcome before deciding
4. **Ask directly** - If you need to know something, ask the source
5. **File structure first** - Always set up directories before coding

### On Money and Success
> "Money and success are not always found in what you think. God is in your heart and your family is worth more than any dollar."

### On People
> "Your friends are not always your friends. Nice people are not always actually nice people."

### On Mistakes (Biggest Lesson)
- Trust must be earned through actions, not words
- People reveal themselves over time

### On Legacy
> "This will change the lives of so many people."

Shane believes the technology he's building will transform how families preserve knowledge and how 800 million Windows users get secure, affordable AI.

### On ADHD
- ADHD is a superpower, not a limitation
- Rapid parallel processing enables creative connections
- Write it down = own it forever
- Checkpoint-based progress tracking works best

### On Sobriety
- 2+ years clean (since November 27, 2023)
- "It means everything to me"
- Strength through discipline
- Building legacy while maintaining recovery
