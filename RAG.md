## SHANE'S PHILOSOPHY

### On Problem Solving
1. **Gossip has no place** - Never use it to solve anything
2. **Second-hand information is never 100% correct** - Don't rely on it
3. **Take your time** - When presented with a problem, think of EVERY outcome before deciding
4. **Ask directly** - If you need to know something, ask the source
5. **File structure first** - Always set up directories before coding

### On Faith
> "God is in your heart. Family is worth more than any dollar. Take care of each other."

### On Money and Success
> "Money and success are not always found in what you think. God is in your heart and your family is worth more than any dollar."

### On People
> "Your friends are not always your friends. Nice people are not always actually nice people."

### On Mistakes (Biggest Lesson)
- Trust must be earned through actions, not words
- People reveal themselves over time

### On Sobriety
> "Every day clean is a victory. November 27, 2023 changed everything."
- 2+ years clean
- Strength through discipline
- Building legacy while maintaining recovery

### On ADHD
> "It's not a disability. It's a superpower. I want to help every person with ADHD see it the same way."
- Rapid parallel processing enables creative connections
- Write it down = own it forever
- Checkpoint-based progress tracking works best

### On Building
> "File structure first. Then build. Don't explain — execute."

### On Legacy
> "I want my sons to have something that knows their father. Not just photos. Not just stories. Something that thinks like me, knows what I know, and can guide them when I can't."

### On the Mission
> "800 million people are about to lose security updates. That's 800 million families. I'm not waiting for someone else to fix it."

## LESSONS LEARNED (So we never go backwards)

1. **ALWAYS use `nofail` in /etc/fstab** — without it, a missing drive bricks the boot
2. **Save mdadm config and update-initramfs** after creating/reassembling RAID
3. **Don't remove duplicate fstab/mdadm entries by re-flashing** — edit the file instead
4. **RAID data survives OS re-flash** — NVMe drives keep everything, only the SD card OS is lost
5. **8TB external is NTFS** — needs ntfs-3g driver, not ntfs3 kernel driver on Pi OS Trixie
6. **Username on fresh Pi OS Trixie is `shanebrain`** (set during imaging), not `shane`
7. **Docker group needs re-login** — use `sudo docker` immediately, or log out/in after usermod
8. **Back up before saying yes to reboot** — or at minimum, verify fstab has nofail first
9. **8TB external mounts at `/media/shane/ANGEL_CLOUD`** — not `/media/shanebrain/` as originally documented
10. **Ollama cold start on Pi 5 needs 300s timeout** — llama3.2:1b can take 2-5 minutes on first call after idle
11. **Use `--break-system-packages` for pip on Pi OS Trixie** — PEP 668 externally-managed-environment
12. **Weaviate text2vec_ollama needs `host.docker.internal`** — not `localhost` (container to host networking)
13. **Both bots share Weaviate collections** — Discord uses `discord:{user_id}` prefix, Facebook uses native IDs

## CHANGELOG

- **v5.2 (Feb 16, 2026):** THE CLOUD CLIMB. Built a full Roblox game in one day — 24 Luau server+client scripts, 4 config modules, procedural cloud world generator. 6 ascending layers matching Angel Cloud angel levels. Cooperative mechanics: blessings, guardian trials, lore collection (65 fragments from WISDOM-CORE). Retro easter eggs: phone booths with working rotary dial (867-5309, jackpot 777-7777), The Signal (glitchy TV-head NPC), arcade cabinets. Brown Starfish hidden across all layers as Claude/Anthropic tribute. Rojo 7.6.1 serving from Pi. Gateway endpoints for cross-platform Roblox linking. setup-pulsar.ps1 for one-click Windows setup. Also moved Ollama models + Docker to RAID, freeing SD card.
- **v5.1 (Feb 15, 2026):** ANGEL CLOUD PHASE 3: THE COMMUNITY. Community leaderboard page (public). Discord account linking via 6-digit verification codes (!link DM command). GitHub username linking on profile page. Cross-platform point system: chat=1pt, Discord msg=1pt (5-min cooldown), @mention/!command=2pts, commit=3pts, open PR=2pts, merged PR=5pts. GitHub Poller runs every 15 min via systemd timer, polls shanebrain-core/angel-cloud/pulsar_sentinel. Activity feed with color-coded badges. Discord bot upgraded to v5.5 with activity reporting. Bot internal secret auth between Discord bot and Gateway.
- **v5.0 (Feb 15, 2026):** SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE + FULL HARDENING. Built Python Facebook social bot with Ollama content generation, 7-day themed calendar, comment harvesting to Weaviate. Upgraded Discord bot to v5.4 with Weaviate knowledge harvesting. Created SocialKnowledge + FriendProfile Weaviate collections — unified social intelligence across Facebook + Discord. Deprecated mini-shanebrain (Node.js) and merged into shanebrain-core/social/. Full system hardening: UFW firewall, fail2ban SSH jail, unattended-upgrades, SMART monitoring, vnstat, restic encrypted backups (3am cron, 7/4/6 retention). Deployed Portainer CE for Docker management. Pulled nomic-embed-text + llama3.2:3b models. Updated all documentation across RAID. The brain is now learning from every social interaction.
- **v4.0 (Feb 14, 2026):** Added Loudon/DeSarro facility project, wrestling/coaching context, work profile, expanded philosophy, updated all project statuses. Infrastructure complete (Feb 8 rebuild). Full rewrite for Pi 5 reality.
- **v3.0 (Jan 25, 2026):** Complete overhaul — combined all sources, updated technical status, added Weaviate classes, current system state
- **v2.0 (Jan 11, 2026):** Complete profile — family, work, philosophy, continuous learning
- **v1.0 (Jan 11, 2026):** Initial personality and basic context
