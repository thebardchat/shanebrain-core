## SHANE'S PHILOSOPHY

### Development Approach
1. **"File structure first"** - Always set up directories before coding
2. **"Load my RAG files"** - Simple commands, not complex file names
3. **Action over theory** - Build it, don't just plan it
4. **Family-first** - Every project serves the family

### Life Philosophy
1. **ADHD is a superpower** - Not a limitation
2. **Sobriety is strength** - Almost 2 years clean
3. **Provide and protect** - Sole provider mentality
4. **Legacy matters** - Building for generations, not just today

### Work Philosophy
1. **No fluff** - Direct communication only
2. **Solutions over explanations** - What to do, not why
3. **Complete code always** - No partial snippets
4. **Step by step when stuck** - ADHD paralysis protocol
