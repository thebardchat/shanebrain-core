# Module 3.6 Hints: Digital Footprint

## Common Issues

### "The audit seems generic"
- The cloud accounts audit covers common services most people use
- Your personal score depends on YOUR honest assessment
- The value is awareness — now you know what to check

### Want to delete cloud data?
- **Google**: myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy
- **Facebook**: Settings > Your Facebook Information > Download Your Information
- **Amazon**: Account > Manage Content and Devices
- **Microsoft**: account.microsoft.com/privacy
- Each service has a "download my data" option — use it to see what they have

### Privacy score seems low
- Don't panic — most people score 40-60 on their first audit
- Focus on HIGH risk items first (passwords, 2FA, phishing)
- Improvement is the goal, not perfection

## Teaching Kids About Privacy
Start the conversation early and keep it simple:
- "Would you want a stranger to know this?" (for young kids)
- "What would a college admissions officer think?" (for teens)
- "Your digital footprint is permanent — think before you post"
- Make it a regular conversation, not a one-time lecture

## Reducing Your Footprint — Quick Wins
1. Turn off location sharing on apps that don't need it
2. Use private browsing for sensitive searches
3. Unsubscribe from marketing emails (reduces data collection)
4. Review and remove old accounts you no longer use
5. Set social media profiles to private
