# Module 3.6: Digital Footprint

## What You'll Build
A privacy audit tool that shows you how much personal data you're sharing,
generates a privacy score, and gives concrete recommendations for reducing
your digital footprint. Includes a family privacy checklist for teaching
kids about online safety.

## Time: ~20 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Module 3.4 complete (Lock It Down — security awareness)
- Module 3.5 complete (Daily Briefing — journal system)
- Ollama running
- Weaviate running on port 8080

## What You'll Learn
1. What your digital footprint actually looks like
2. How to audit your cloud accounts and data sharing
3. Practical steps to reduce what you share
4. **Security lesson**: Your digital footprint is bigger than you think

## The Security Lesson: You're Sharing More Than You Know

Every day, without thinking about it, you share data with:
- **Google** — every search, every map direction, every YouTube video
- **Facebook/Meta** — every like, every photo, every message
- **Amazon** — every purchase, every browse, every Alexa command
- **Apple/Microsoft** — every file synced, every location ping
- **Your phone** — tracks your location 24/7, even "off"

Most people have 50-100+ online accounts. Each one has:
- Your name and email
- Often your phone number
- Your browsing habits on that site
- Your purchase history
- Your location data

**This module makes the invisible visible.** You can't fix what you
can't see. Once you see your footprint, you can start shrinking it.

## Audit Categories

| Category | What We Check | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Cloud Accounts | How many services have your data | Each account is an exposure point |
| Browser Data | What your browser stores | Cookies, history, saved passwords |
| App Permissions | What apps access on your device | Camera, mic, location, contacts |
| Data Sharing | What you share on social media | Public info anyone can find |
| Family Exposure | Kids' digital presence | Children's data needs extra protection |

---

## The Privacy Score

Your privacy score (0-100) is based on:
- Number of cloud accounts with your data
- Whether you use default privacy settings
- Social media exposure level
- Password hygiene
- Kids' online presence management

**Higher = better privacy practices.** This isn't about perfection —
it's about awareness and incremental improvement.

## After the Exercise

You'll have a PrivacyAudit collection with your findings, a privacy score,
and concrete action items. The family checklist gives you talking points
for discussing online safety with your kids.

Module 3.7 ties everything together into the Family Dashboard.
