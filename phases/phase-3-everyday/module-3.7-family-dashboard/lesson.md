# Module 3.7 — Family Dashboard (Capstone)

## WHAT YOU'LL BUILD

A complete view of your personal AI system — services, knowledge, relationships, and a live conversation with your AI about what it knows. This is the capstone for Phase 3. You'll pull together everything you've built across the entire phase into one exercise that proves your AI is not a toy. It's a tool that knows your documents, writes your drafts, tracks your journal, audits itself, and answers questions about your life.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

You. The person who built a vault, wrote drafts, journaled daily, and audited your footprint. Now you're going to see it all at once and have a conversation with the AI you built. This is the moment you stop being a user and become someone whose AI actually knows them.

## KEY TERMS

- **Dashboard**: A single view that pulls data from multiple sources to give you the full picture. Like the morning meeting at a concrete company — job status, crew assignments, equipment, weather — all in one room, all in five minutes.

- **system_health**: Your infrastructure check. Services running, collections populated, everything green or red. The truck inspection before you leave the yard.

- **search_knowledge**: Searches what the AI knows — built-in wisdom and things you've taught it. This is the AI's memory, and you're checking what's in there.

- **get_top_friends**: Pulls your relationship network — friend profiles ranked by relationship strength. Your AI keeps track of the people in your life.

- **vault_search**: Semantic search across your personal documents. Medical records, work references, family notes — all searchable by meaning.

- **chat_with_shanebrain**: A full RAG conversation with your AI. It searches its knowledge, pulls context, and generates a response through Ollama. This is the real deal — your AI talking to you about your life using everything it knows.

## THE LESSON

### The Capstone Idea

Phase 3 gave you five capabilities:

| Module | Capability | What It Proved |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 3.1 | Private Vault | You can store and search personal documents |
| 3.2 | Ask Your Vault | Your AI answers questions from your docs |
| 3.3 | Write It Right | Draft writing with vault context |
| 3.4 | Lock It Down | Security and privacy controls |
| 3.5 | Daily Briefing | Journaling with AI-generated summaries |
| 3.6 | Digital Footprint | System audit and data visibility |

Each module proved one thing. The capstone proves they all work together.

### Building the Complete View

A family dashboard pulls four perspectives:

**1. System Overview** — Is everything running? Are collections populated? This is the foundation check before you build anything on top of it.

**2. Knowledge Check** — What does your AI know about family? About work? About the things that matter? Search the knowledge base and see what comes back.

**3. Social View** — Who are the people in your AI's world? Friend profiles show your relationship network — names, context, connection strength. Your AI remembers the people you told it about.

**4. Personal AI Conversation** — Talk to your AI. Ask it to summarize what it knows about you and your system. This is the final proof that everything connects — the AI pulls from knowledge, vault, friends, and notes to give you a real answer.

### Why This Matters

Most people use AI like a search engine — type a question, get an answer, forget about it. You built something different. Your AI:

- **Stores** your documents (vault)
- **Writes** for you (drafts)
- **Remembers** your day (journal)
- **Tracks** your people (friends)
- **Audits** itself (footprint)
- **Talks** to you about all of it (chat)

That's not a chatbot. That's a personal AI system. And it runs on YOUR hardware, with YOUR data, under YOUR control.

### The Family Connection

The name "Family Dashboard" is deliberate. The best technology serves the people you care about. A personal AI that tracks medical records keeps your family safe. One that journals your days preserves your story. One that knows your people strengthens your relationships.

This isn't about the technology. It's about what the technology protects.
