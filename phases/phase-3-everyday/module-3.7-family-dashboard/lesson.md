AI toolkit — running entirely on YOUR machine.

## Time: ~15 minutes

## What You'll Learn
1. How to combine multiple AI tools into a single interface

## The Security Lesson: Your Family's AI, Under Your Roof

Look at what you've built in Phase 3:
- A personal knowledge vault (family records, recipes, health info)
- A Q&A system that answers questions about your family
- A writing assistant that knows your tone and context
- A security awareness tool
- A personal journal with daily briefings
- A privacy audit with family safety checklist

Now imagine ALL of that on someone else's server. Your family's medical
records, your writing style, your daily thoughts, your security findings,
your children's online safety audit — all in a corporation's database.

**With the Family Dashboard, none of that leaves your house.** Every tool,
every query, every piece of data runs on YOUR machine. No subscription.
No account. No terms of service. No data mining.

This is what personal AI should be.
