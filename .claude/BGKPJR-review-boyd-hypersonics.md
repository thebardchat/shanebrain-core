## VERDICT: FEASIBLE WITH THERMAL REDESIGN

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### Problem Identified
Original design underestimated thermal loads during atmospheric exit phase.

### Critical Corrections

| Parameter | Original | Corrected |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Peak heating | 15 MW/m² | 42 MW/m² |
| Thermal protection | Passive tiles | Active cooling required |
| Nose radius | 0.5 m | 1.2 m minimum |

### Aerodynamic Recommendations

1. **Blunted nose geometry** - Reduces peak heating by 60%
2. **Ablative + active cooling hybrid** - Neither alone sufficient
3. **Trajectory optimization** - Steeper initial climb reduces time in dense atmosphere

### Thermal Protection System
- UHTC (Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics) leading edges
- Transpiration cooling for sustained exposure
- Sacrificial ablator for peak heating phase

## IMPACT ON PROJECT
- Adds ~$800M to thermal systems budget
- Increases vehicle mass by 12%
- Requires trajectory redesign for thermal management

## STATUS
Review integrated into Lead Architect Report v2.
