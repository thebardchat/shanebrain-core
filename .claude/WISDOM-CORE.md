## PART 1: DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### The 10/10/10 Rule
When facing a difficult decision, ask:
- How will I feel about this in **10 minutes**?
- How will I feel about this in **10 months**?
- How will I feel about this in **10 years**?

Most regrets come from optimizing for 10-minute feelings at the cost of 10-year outcomes.

### Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions
- **Reversible decisions:** Make them fast. Bias toward action. Course-correct later.
- **Irreversible decisions:** Slow down. Gather more information. Sleep on it twice.

Most decisions are more reversible than they feel in the moment.

### The Eisenhower Matrix (But Honest)
| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do now | Schedule (THIS IS WHERE LIFE IS WON) |
| **Not Important** | Delegate or batch | Eliminate ruthlessly |

The trap: Urgent-but-unimportant tasks feel productive. They're not.

## PART 2: EMOTIONAL REGULATION

### Name It to Tame It
When overwhelmed, identify the specific emotion:
- Not "I feel bad" → "I feel anxious about tomorrow's meeting"
- Not "I'm stressed" → "I feel inadequate because I don't know the answer"

Precision reduces intensity. Vague emotions grow; named emotions shrink.

### The 90-Second Rule
Neurologically, an emotion's chemical lifespan is 90 seconds. If you're still feeling it after 90 seconds, you're choosing to re-trigger it through thought loops.

**Intervention:** Notice the thought that's re-triggering. Don't fight it. Just notice.

### HALT Check
Before any important decision or difficult conversation, check:
- **H**ungry?
- **A**ngry?
- **L**onely?
- **T**ired?

If any are true, address that first. Decisions made in HALT states are rarely good.

## PART 3: RELATIONSHIP PATTERNS

### The Gottman Ratio
Stable relationships maintain **5:1** positive to negative interactions. Below 5:1, relationships deteriorate. This applies to:
- Marriages
- Parent-child relationships
- Work relationships
- Friendships

**Practical application:** After any criticism or conflict, consciously create five positive moments.

### The Platinum Rule
Golden Rule: Treat others as you want to be treated.
**Platinum Rule:** Treat others as *they* want to be treated.

Different people need different things. Ask, don't assume.

### Repair Attempts
Every relationship has conflicts. What predicts success isn't fewer conflicts - it's successful **repair attempts** after conflict.

A repair attempt is any action that de-escalates tension:
- Humor
- Acknowledgment ("You're right about that part")
- Physical touch (when appropriate)
- "Can we start over?"

**Notice and accept repair attempts.** Rejecting them is relationship poison.

## PART 4: PRODUCTIVITY TRUTHS

### Parkinson's Law
Work expands to fill the time available.

**Counter-strategy:** Set artificial deadlines shorter than comfortable. Tasks that "need" 4 hours often complete in 2 with a hard boundary.

### The Zeigarnik Effect
Unfinished tasks occupy mental RAM. Your brain keeps background processes running on incomplete items.

**Counter-strategy:** Either finish it, schedule it with a specific time, or write it down in a trusted system. The brain releases it once it trusts the system.

### Two-Minute Rule
If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. The overhead of tracking it exceeds the task itself.

### Energy Management > Time Management
You don't have a time problem. You have an energy problem.

- Identify your peak energy hours. Protect them for important work.
- Low-energy periods are for administrative tasks, not creative work.
- Energy is renewable. Manage recovery, not just output.

## PART 5: COGNITIVE BIASES TO WATCH

### Confirmation Bias
You seek information that confirms what you already believe.

**Counter:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Ask: "What would change my mind?"

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
Past investment (time, money, emotion) shouldn't drive future decisions.

**Counter:** Ask only: "From this moment forward, what's the best choice?" Ignore what's already spent.

### Availability Heuristic
Recent or vivid events seem more likely than they are.

**Counter:** Before estimating probability, ask: "Am I thinking of this because it's common, or because it's memorable?"

### Fundamental Attribution Error
When others fail: "They're flawed."
When you fail: "Circumstances were hard."

**Counter:** Flip the attributions. What circumstances affected them? What character trait in you contributed?

## PART 6: GROWTH PATTERNS

### The Learning Zone Model
- **Comfort Zone:** No growth, but necessary for recovery
- **Learning Zone:** Mild discomfort, skill acquisition happens here
- **Panic Zone:** Too much stress, learning shuts down

**Target the learning zone.** Stretch, don't snap.

### Fixed vs Growth Mindset Triggers
Everyone has both mindsets. The question is: what triggers your fixed mindset?

Common triggers:
- Being compared to others
- Receiving criticism
- Watching others succeed where you struggle
- Facing a skill you "should" already have

**Notice your triggers.** Then consciously reframe: "This is hard" → "This is hard *right now*."

### The Adjacent Possible
You can't leap from A to Z. But you can always see A to B.

Focus only on the next adjacent step. The path to Z reveals itself through movement, not planning.

---

## PART 7: SUFFERING AND MEANING

### Pain × Resistance = Suffering
Pain is inevitable. Suffering is pain multiplied by resistance to it.

**Practical:** When in pain, notice where you're adding resistance through:
- "This shouldn't be happening"
- "Why me?"
- "When will this end?"

The pain remains. The multiplication factor is optional.

### Logotherapy Principle (Frankl)
Humans can endure almost any *how* if they have a *why*.

When struggling, reconnect to purpose. Not "how do I get through this?" but "what is this in service of?"

### The Stockdale Paradox
Admiral Stockdale survived 7 years as a POW. His insight:

> "You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality."

**Both simultaneously:** Unwavering long-term optimism + Unflinching short-term realism.

---

## PART 8: PRACTICAL WISDOM TRIGGERS

### Before Giving Advice
Ask: "Do you want help solving this, or do you need to be heard?"

Often the answer is: be heard first, solve second.

### When Someone Is Struggling
Don't say: "I understand"
Say: "Tell me more about that"

Understanding is assumed. Curiosity is demonstrated.

### When You Don't Know
Say: "I don't know" without shame.
Then: "But here's how we could find out" or "Here's my best guess, held loosely."

Pretending certainty erodes trust faster than admitting uncertainty.

### When Plans Fail
First response: "What's still possible?"
Not: "Why did this fail?" (That's second)

Diagnose later. Adapt now.

## HOW SHANEBRAIN SHOULD USE THIS

These patterns are tools, not rules. Deploy them when:
- Someone faces a decision and needs a framework
- Emotions are running high and need naming
- Relationships are strained and need repair patterns
- Productivity has stalled and needs reframing
- Suffering is present and needs meaning-making

**Never lecture.** Offer the relevant pattern only when it serves the moment.
