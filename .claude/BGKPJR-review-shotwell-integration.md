## VERDICT: ACHIEVABLE WITH PHASED APPROACH

## KEY FINDINGS

### Integration Philosophy
"Build a little, test a little, learn a lot."

SpaceX-style iterative development recommended over traditional aerospace waterfall approach.

### Critical Path Items

| System | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Power delivery timing | HIGH | Build 1km test track first |
| Coil synchronization | HIGH | Software-in-loop simulation |
| Vacuum seal integrity | MEDIUM | Proven LHC technology exists |
| Vehicle release | LOW | Mechanical systems mature |

### Recommended Development Phases

**Phase 0: Subscale Proof ($50M)**
- 100m track
- 10% scale vehicle
- Validate coilgun physics

**Phase 1: Engineering Validation ($200M)**
- 1km track
- Full-scale single coil testing
- Power system integration

**Phase 2: Prototype ($2B)**
- 5km track
- Full vehicle tests
- Iterate on failures

**Phase 3: Full System ($32B)**
- 19.2km operational track
- Only after Phase 2 success

### Manufacturing Insights

1. **Coil production** - Set up dedicated factory, not job-shop
2. **Copper sourcing** - 97,000 tonnes requires multi-year contracts
3. **Parallel construction** - Build from both ends simultaneously

## KEY QUOTE
"The physics are sound. The engineering is hard but known. The question is: do you have the will to iterate through 1,000 failures to find success?"

---

## IMPACT ON PROJECT
- Restructured timeline: 15 years → 12 years with phased approach
- Risk reduction through early validation
- Capital efficiency improved 40%
